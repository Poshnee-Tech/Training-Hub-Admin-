/**
 * Pre-hydration cleanup for attributes injected by browser extensions.
 *
 * Bitdefender's browser extension scans pages for form fields to "skin" and
 * stamps `bis_skin_checked="1"` onto the wrapping elements. When it wins the
 * race against React, the server HTML and the client tree disagree on every
 * stamped node and React reports a hydration mismatch, then recovers by
 * throwing away the SSR markup and re-rendering the whole subtree on the
 * client. Functionally harmless, but it costs a full client render and buries
 * genuine hydration bugs under noise.
 *
 * `suppressHydrationWarning` cannot fix this: it covers one element's own
 * attributes and never its descendants, and the stamped nodes are arbitrary
 * divs deep in the tree.
 *
 * What makes this tractable is that React only inspects the DOM *during*
 * hydration. Strip the attribute until hydration settles and React never looks
 * again — so we do exactly that, then disconnect and leave the extension alone.
 *
 * Runs as a blocking inline script at the end of <body>: after the markup the
 * extension stamps exists, before Next's deferred bundle hydrates. The
 * MutationObserver covers the other ordering, where the extension's content
 * script runs at document_idle and stamps after us.
 *
 * Keep in sync with the copy in Training-Simulator-Frontend-. Add other
 * vendors' markers to ATTRS as they turn up; the observer is filtered to just
 * these names, so the cost is negligible.
